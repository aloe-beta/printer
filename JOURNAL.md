## 10/31/2025 - Started project and created initial frame.  

I thought it might be fun to make a core-xy 3D printer. If I succeed, I get a 3D printer; otherwise, I still get more experience with the design process. Because I'm using OpenSCAD to design this, I can create variables for things like the extrusion length, and change it later without having to remodel the entire frame.

I started by creating the frame from 2020 extrusion (as it's relatively cheap and sturdy). I made part of the top frame lower than the rest to add space between the belt system and tool carriage later on.

## 11/1/2025 - Created initial carriage assembly.  

I spent several hours researching and trying various things for the carriage assembly. I started with linear rails, but those are expensive (I didn't take a picture).

Then I tried rods with linear bearings, but they looked bulky and difficult to mount, and I felt it would restrict the build plate size too much on the y-axis.

Eventually I decided I wanted to try using v-slot wheels because they're cheaper than the last two options. Unfortunately, the library I was using for hardware parts doesn't support any v-slot components, so I spent a while implementing those myself, from 2020 v-slot extrusion to eccentric M5 nuts and roller wheels. This is my result:

Next, I'll probably work on the belt assembly.

## 10/31/2025 - Started project and created initial frame.  

I thought it might be fun to make a core-xy 3D printer. If I succeed, I get a 3D printer; otherwise, I still get more experience with the design process. Because I'm using OpenSCAD to design this, I can create variables for things like the extrusion length, and change it later without having to remodel the entire frame.

I started by creating the frame from 2020 extrusion (as it's relatively cheap and sturdy). I made part of the top frame lower than the rest to add space between the belt system and tool carriage later on.
